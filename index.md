## About

The Data and Computing Noho marae is aimed at strengthening our knowledge of these areas and our Tuākana ties. We will achieve this through kōrero, wānaga, and kai as we stay together at Te Aka Matua ki Te Pou Hawaiki marae on Epsom Campus.

People are welcome from all skill levels and all levels of study from 100- to 700-level across the Faculty of Science or Software Engineering.

The noho is a fully catered and free event, with accommodation at the marae.

It is based on a [similar event that ran in 2021](./2021hackanoho).

## Possible projects for discussion

At the last noho, we came up with  a list of possible projects people may want to look at or discuss. If any of the below interest you or you have your own project, 

* Create a website on health and technology based on Te Whare Tapa Whā principles
* Creating visualisations for the data on Te Reo Maori and other Pacific languages
* Modelling how New Zealand media portray environmental issues
* Creating maps to visualise pollution by region
* Exploring prospects for language survival using mathematical models based on a [recent paper](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsif.2019.0526)
* Working with people from [Papa Reo](https://papareo.nz/) on machine learning applied to Māori and Pacific Languages
* Working to improve the noho concept and delivery

Just to emphasise: these are suggestions only. We will approach questions like these from whatever background we already have and do not expect to "complete" any project in a single weekend.

Some of these ideas have been fleshed out a little with skeleton code provided at <https://github.com/hackanoho/project-ideas>.

## COVID-19

To keep the noho safe and make sure there is no have significant spread of Covid-19 during the event, we ask everyone to **take a RAT test on Friday before coming**. 

There will be RATs available on site so people can test again on Saturday morning.
