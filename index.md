## Possible projects

You are free to bring your own project ideas if you have them but we have also come up with a few ideas ourselves. Here's a list:

* Create a website on health and technology based on Te Whare Tapa Whā principles
* Creating visualisations for the data on Te Reo Maori and other Pacific languages
* Modelling how New Zealand media portray environmental issues
* Creating maps to visualise pollution by region
* Using the SMAT (social media analysis tool) API to analyse conspiracy theories on social media
* Exploring prospects for language survival using mathematical models based on a [recent paper](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsif.2019.0526)
* Working with people from [Papa Reo](https://papareo.nz/) on machine learning applied to Māori and Pacific Languages
* Working to improve the hacka-noho concept and delivery

Just to emphasise: these are suggestions only. We will approach questions like these from whatever background we already have and do not expect to "complete" any project in a single weekend.

Some of these ideas have been fleshed out a little with skeleton code provided at https://github.com/hackanoho/project-ideas.

## Questions and answers

* Q: What do I need to know to come along?
  * A: Not a whole lot. The hacka-noho is aimed at people with all skill levels in the Faculty who have done or are doing any Stats or Comp Sci course (or similar data/programming type courses)   
* Q: Do I need to be there the whole time?
  * A: No. If you have work or other commitments that mean you can only come for part of it, you can still come along.
* Q: What do I need to bring?
  * A: Accomodation is in the whare nui so bring a sleeping bag and whatever personal items you need. If you have a lap-top or other device, you can bring that too. 
* Q: Can I borrow a laptop?
  * A: Probably. Let us know you need one.  
* Q: How can I register to attend?
